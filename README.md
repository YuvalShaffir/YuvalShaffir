## [Accountability-Tracker (2023)](https://github.com/YuvalShaffir/accountabilityTracker) - In Progress
### Browsing history data scrapper, uses ML to categorize websites and sends a pie chart to an accountability friend through Telegram.
Following the events of the October 7th war, I observed a significant surge in news and social media consumption among my friends, family, and myself. 
This surge negatively impacted our work efficiency, prompting me to seek a solution. Drawing from my experiences with accountability partners during my student life, I developed a tool aimed at enhancing productivity.

This tool generates a categorized pie chart of my internet usage, breaking down the data into specific subjects such as Work, Social Media, News, and more.
To achieve this, I utilize cloudscraper for website data scraping and the Google Language V1 categorization model to analyze and categorize the metadata from various websites. 
This innovative approach not only addresses the challenges posed by increased media consumption but also provides a tangible solution for maintaining focus and productivity.

## [ImProUtils (2023)](https://github.com/YuvalShaffir/ImProUtils) - In Progress
### This is an image-processing utility library that I created to boost my future projects and also dive deep into many image-processing subjects.
The most impactful course I've undertaken during my university journey is undoubtedly the Image Processing course. It wasn't the ease of the exams that made it stand out; in fact, it was one of the most challenging courses. 
Its significance lies in its inherent interest to me and the profound impact it had on redirecting my career path.

Motivated by my passion for the subject, I crafted this utility library to serve as a valuable resource for my upcoming projects in the realm of Image Processing. 
Beyond aiding in future endeavors, the library serves as a tool for delving deep into both the concepts I've already learned and those I aspire to explore further.
